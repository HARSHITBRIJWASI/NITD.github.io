                            students, there would hardly be any student who isn't aware of the meaning of the
                            term Internship. Still if you were to Google the meaning of the term
                            the dictionary meaning comes as, the position of a student or
                            trainee who works in an organization, sometimes without pay, in order
                            to gain work experience or satisfy requirements for
                            a qualification.<br><br>In simpler terms an
                            internship is a job that the student takes up while he is st ill
                            in college. It might be either paid or unpaid but the main mot ive of
                            the student is to gain experience of the corporate world before
                            actually sett ing foot in it.</p>

                            <p>The rise in global competition has prompted organizations to devise strategies
                                to have a talented and innovative workforce to gain a competitive
                                edge. Competition in the job sector is rising exponentially and
                                securing entry-level jobs is getting very difficult , as the
                                students passing out from technical institutions lack the
                                experience and skills required by industry. The main aim of
                                internship is enhancement of the employ ability skills of
                                the students passing out from Technical Institutions.</p>
