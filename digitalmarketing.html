        <h1 style="color: #393185"><b>Digital Marketing</b></h1><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding: right 50px;">With traditional marketing on the decline and digital
            becoming the new regular, Digital Marketing is a
            continually expanding sector with tremendous career growth possibilities. Digital Marketing careers are
            among the most in-demand occupations worldwide.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding: right 50px;">Without a doubt, there are several job prospects in Digital
            Marketing that are varied and creative. To be a
            successful Digital Marketer in today's highly competitive market, you must be well-versed in the newest
            digital technology, tools, and techniques.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #393185"><b>Types of Digital Marketing</b></h2><br>
        <h4>
            <li style="padding-left:50px;">Content Marketing: -</li>
        </h4>
        <p>They are eager to acquire the knowledge that will allow them to address their concerns and fulfill their
            objectives. If your brand consistently produces high-quality, helpful content, your audience will trust you
            more and more.</p>
        <p>This tactic comprises responding to questions brought up by your target audience. It may be done via blogs,
            social media, email, and other channels. Articles on blogs are only one example of the many material forms
            available.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the kind of material used in content marketing is determined by the funnel that serves as its
            guide. For instance, content like extensive manuals should be more generic towards the top of the funnel.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <li>Email Marketing: -</li>
        </h4>
        <p>However, some still think email marketing is useless, even though countless emails are sent daily. It's one
            of the most effective kinds of online advertising. Applying strategy to its use may provide valuable
            results.</p>
        <p>One way to do this is to provide subscribers access to relevant and valuable material at the right moment.
            Respecting your audience's privacy and refraining from sending spam while promoting your products or
            services are critical to your success.</p>
        <p>The effectiveness of an inbound marketing effort is mainly based on email. With automation, you can easily
            direct your consumer through the marketing funnel. Emails also provide a direct line of connection with
            customers.</p>
        <h4>
            <li>Influence Marketing: -</li>
        </h4>
        <p>Now that we've started talking about them, it's essential to define digital influencers: they are subject
            matter experts who have amassed a substantial fan base interested in hearing what they have to say.</p>
        <p>Digital influencers may produce original material for your company if they find it compelling and relevant to
            their audiences. They are allowed to put the findings of any tests they do on your products on display,
            whether or not they are positive. They have the power to build or destroy your reputation as a consequence.
        </p>
        <p>More and more businesses are seeing success with influencer marketing. While there is always the chance that
            the influencer would say or do something that damages your brand's image, the enthusiasm of their fan base
            may bring in many new clients despite the dangers involved.</p>
        <h4>
            <li>Search Engine Optimization: -</li>
        </h4>
        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the act of producing material such that search engines like Google will
            rank it highly on the results page (SERP). Search engines use algorithms to assess your website's relevance
            to a user's search terms.</p>
        <p>Since these algorithms are updated continuously, SEO methods must also be adjusted periodically to remain
            relevant. When search engine optimization (SEO) techniques are used correctly, your website will rise to the
            top of search engine rankings, getting a higher volume of free, organic traffic.</p>
        <p>It raises the chances of your articles being found on the first page of the results. Consequently, someone
            actively seeking what you have to offer will discover your website—knowing the search phrases that the
            audience you want to target makes SEO more successful. You must then build your content around these
            keywords.</p>
        <h4>
            <li>Social Media Marketing: -</li>
        </h4>
        <p>Social media marketing uses digital marketing tools like social networking sites. You can buy ads to reach
            new groups of people. You could also make a profile for your business on any social media site and keep it
            up to date with information about sales, new products, or recently published content.</p>
        <p>Which social media site you use will depend on the kind of people you want to reach. For example, Facebook is
            the best way to get people over 65, while Instagram is the best way to reach people between the ages of 25
            and 29.</p>
